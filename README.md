# Mapping_Earthquakes
The purpose of this challenge is to create an earthquake map with multiple layers and styles. This will help assess earthquakes by magnitude and location, in comparison with tectonic plate date, and to review earthquakes on various types of maps. The first layer group includes all earthquake data, the second layer includes tectonic plate data, and the third layer includes data related to major earthquakes within the past week.
